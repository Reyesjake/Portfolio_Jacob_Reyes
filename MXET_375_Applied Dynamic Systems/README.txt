This project focuses on the development of an autocorrecting dynamic pendulum system for a robotic vehicle, integrating modeling, control systems, simulation, and physical prototyping. Aimed at reinforcing concepts in automation and control engineering, the project mirrors real-world industrial applications through hands-on implementation. The control system was designed and simulated using Simulink in MATLAB, while the pendulum component was modeled and fabricated using Creo 3D software and 3D printing. This multidisciplinary approach provided practical experience in applying theoretical knowledge to a functional, small-scale autonomous system.
