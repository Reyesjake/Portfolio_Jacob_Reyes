This project focuses on reconstructing a brushless DC (BLDC) motor display to serve as an educational tool for understanding motor operation and control. BLDC motors are widely used for their efficiency and durability, featuring a stator with energized coils and a rotor with permanent magnets. The project involves redesigning the motorâ€™s base and rotor for improved performance and integrating speed control via the USB6002 Data Acquisition Module. A Hall effect sensor is employed to detect magnetic fields, enabling precise coil switching and rotation tracking. This hands-on approach enhances student comprehension of BLDC motor dynamics and control systems.
