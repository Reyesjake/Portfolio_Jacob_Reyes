This project explores the fundamentals of wireless communication by implementing a Wi-Fiâ€“controlled robotic vehicle. Using a tablet or smartphone, users interact with a custom-built website to send directional commands to the vehicle via the CC3200-LAUNCHXL board, which interfaces with the TI MSP-EXP432P4111 microcontroller. The system also features an autonomous "Following Mode," enabling the vehicle to track a target using an ultrasonic sensor and respond to hand claps via an ADMP504 microphone for start/stop commands. An AC-1005G-RPA-LF buzzer provides audible feedback to enhance safety. Through this hands-on application of Wi-Fi and Internet of Things principles, the project prepares students for careers in wireless automation and remote system control.
