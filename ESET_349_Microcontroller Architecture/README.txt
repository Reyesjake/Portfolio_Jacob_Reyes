This project explores a cost-effective approach to autonomous navigation by developing an obstacle detection and avoidance system using ultrasonic sensors. Designed for small-scale motorized vehicles operating in predictable environments, the system utilizes the TI MSP-EXP432P4111 microcontroller to interpret sensor inputs and control motor responses. Programmed in assembly language, the microcontroller enables the vehicle to react dynamically: turning away from detected obstacles within 25 cm, stopping when both sensors detect obstructions, and proceeding forward when the path is clear. This simplified autonomous system demonstrates practical automation without reliance on expensive hardware or complex AI.
