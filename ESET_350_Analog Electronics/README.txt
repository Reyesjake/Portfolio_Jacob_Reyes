This project presents the design and implementation of an analog temperature gauge using LEDs to visually indicate temperature levels for systems lacking built-in monitoring. The gauge employs an AD22100 temperature sensor paired with multiple voltage comparators to trigger LEDs at specific temperature thresholds. A custom voltage divider circuit generates distinct reference voltages for each comparator, corresponding to target temperatures ranging from 20℃ to 100℃ in 20℃ increments. By comparing the sensor’s output voltage to these references, the system activates LEDs to reflect the measured temperature. The final circuit was assembled on a breadboard and powered by a 5V supply, successfully demonstrating a simple, effective method for real-time temperature indication.
