This project aims to develop an autonomous vehicle capable of navigating a designated path, detecting and avoiding obstacles, and responding to stop signs using computer vision and sensor integration. The vehicle follows a green-colored road via a Logitech HD webcam and Raspberry Pi, while obstacle detection is handled by a SICK TiM651 LIDAR sensor with a 270Â° field of view. Upon identifying an obstacle, the vehicle halts; when a stop sign is detected, it pauses for five seconds before resuming motion. The system builds upon prior lab and lecture work, incorporating modified LIDAR field parameters and HSV-based color tracking to enhance path-following and object recognition capabilities.
